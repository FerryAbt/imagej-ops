/**
 * A {@code Function} is an {@link Op} that has a typed input parameter, and a
 * typed output parameter.
 * <p>
 * The function provides a {@link #compute} method to compute the function for
 * different input and output parameters.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the typed output is actually considered both an input <em>and</em>
 * an output parameter; in ImageJ module terms, its type is {@link ItemIO#BOTH}.
 * This fact is critical so that a preallocated data structure may be passed in
 * and filled by the function. It is <em>required</em> that if an output value
 * is given in this way, it will be populated with the function's result.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Lastly, functions implement the {@link Threadable} interface, and hence can
 * be reused across multiple threads of a {@link Parallel} op.
 * </p>
